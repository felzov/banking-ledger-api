# banking-ledger-api

A production-oriented banking backend built around a **double-entry ledger**: ACID money
movement, concurrency control, idempotent APIs, and an append-only audit trail.

> **Status: Phase 1 of 10. Repository and development environment.**
> Only the application skeleton and a liveness endpoint exist so far. The design below is
> approved and documented in the [ADRs](docs/adr/), but it is not implemented yet.

All data is synthetic. No real financial information, credentials or personal data are used.

## Technology stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.14 |
| Web framework | FastAPI, Pydantic v2 |
| Database | PostgreSQL 18 (planned access: SQLAlchemy 2.0 async with asyncpg, migrations with Alembic) |
| Tooling | uv, ruff, mypy (strict), pytest, pre-commit (including gitleaks) |
| Runtime | Docker, Docker Compose |

## Local setup

Prerequisites: Docker with Compose v2+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and GNU Make.

```bash
cd banking-ledger-api
cp .env.example .env        # synthetic local-only values
make install                # create .venv from uv.lock
make up                     # build and start PostgreSQL and the API
curl localhost:8000/health/live
```

Interactive API docs: <http://localhost:8000/docs>

To enable the git hooks, run this once from the repository root:

```bash
banking-ledger-api/.venv/bin/pre-commit install
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Used by | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `APP_ENV` | api | `development` | One of `development`, `test`, `production`. Validated at startup |
| `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` / `POSTGRES_DB` | db | (required) | Database bootstrap credentials |
| `POSTGRES_PORT` | compose | `5432` | Host port, bound to 127.0.0.1 |
| `API_PORT` | compose | `8000` | Host port, bound to 127.0.0.1 |

## Development commands

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `make up` / `make down` | Start or stop the stack. Data is kept in the `pgdata` volume |
| `make logs` | Follow container logs |
| `make test` | Run the test suite |
| `make lint` / `make fmt` | Lint and format check, or auto-fix |
| `make typecheck` | `mypy --strict` |
| `make check` | All quality gates |

## API

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health/live` | Liveness: the process is serving requests. It checks no dependencies |
